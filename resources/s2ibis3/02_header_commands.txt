THE HEADER

    The header contains information that is applicable to the entire
    file, such as the type of SPICE simulator to use, the IBIS version,
    etc. It can also contain global specifications. For example, if
    you want a particular temperature range to apply to all models in
    your file, specify it in the header. Note, however, that global
    definitions are overridden by local definitions; in this way, you
    can specify (e.g.) a global temperature range, but override it for a
    particular component or model where necessary.

    The following commands can be used in the header:

    [IBIS Ver]  version

        version = 1.1, 2.1 or 3.2
        
        Required.
        
        THIS MUST BE THE FIRST COMMAND IN THE COMMAND FILE. (It may be
        preceded by comments.)  This describes the version of IBIS to be
        produced by s2ibis3. Legal version values are 1.1 and 2.1.

    [File name] filename

        filename = name of IBIS file to produce
        
        Optional.  
        Default: First 8 chars of command filename followed by ".ibs".

        This tells s2ibis3 what the output file name should be. NOTE:
        this must conform to DOS conventions, i.e. it must be in the
        form "xxxxxxxx.xxx". If this command is not used, s2ibis3
        creates the output file name by taking the first part of the
        command file name, and appending ".ibs" to it. So, for the
        command file name "tryme.s2i", the output file name would be
        "tryme.ibs".

    [File rev]  rev

        rev = revision number
        
        Optional.
        Default: none.

        This describes the current file revision. Note that s2ibis3
        will accept any legal string for the revision number, although
        the IBIS specification suggests a standard for revision
        numbering.

    [Date]      date

        date = file date
        
        Optional.
        Default: Current system date.

        Gives the file date. If this command is not present, s2ibis3
        will use the current system date as the file date.

    [Source]    source

        source = file source
        
        Optional.
        Default: none.
        
        Describes the file source. Truncated if longer than 1K byte in
        length.

    [Notes]     notes

        notes = file notes
        
        Optional.
        Default: none.
        
        Describes any optional notes that may be necessary. Truncated
        if longer than 1K byte in length.

    [Disclaimer]    disclaimer

        disclaimer = file disclaimer
        
        Optional.
        Default: none.
        
        This is where you put the legalese. Truncated if longer than 1K
        byte in length.

    [Copyright] copyright

        source = file copyright
        
        Optional.
        Default: none.
        
        Describes the copyright info. Truncated if longer than 1K byte
        in length.

    [Spice type]    spicetype

        spicetype = HSpice, PSpice, Spice2, Spice3, or Spectre

        Required.
        
        Describes which flavor of Spice to use when simulating the
        circuits.

    [Spice command] command

        command = command to use when invoking Spice.

        Optional.
        Default: specified in s2iHeader.java
        
        This string specifies, in java syntax, how you would call Spice
        from the command line. See the string variable defaultSpiceCommand           
	in the file src/s2iHeader.java for an example of the correct format.         
	(Note that the command line switches used to invoke spice3 and               
	spectre MUST be used.)

    [Iterate]

        Optional.
        Default: none.
        
        This works the same way as the *[Iterate] command in s2ibis
        v1.2. If a Spice output file for the curve in question already
        exists, s2ibis3 will read the data from that file without
        re-running the simulation. In this way, you can make
        incremental changes to your s2ibis3 files without having to
        re-simulate the entire set of models.

    [Cleanup]
    
        Optional.
        Default: none.
        
        When this command is specified, s2ibis3 will delete all of the
        spice input, output and message files as it proceeds. This is
        good to use when you think the IBIS file is done and you want to
        clean up the working directory.
