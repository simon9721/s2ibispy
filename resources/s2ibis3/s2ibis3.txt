INTRODUCTION

    s2ibis3 is the latest version of the SPICE-to-IBIS conversion
    utility from North Carolina State University. It produces IBIS
    files which conform to the IBIS v3.2 specification.

    s2ibis3 is similar to s2ibis2. The main difference to it is that
    it is written in JAVA as compared to C and Lex and Yacc.
    s2ibis3 has its own command language, which is similar to the
    IBIS language in many respects, and can be easily extended to
    include new functionality. Because s2ibis3 creates a full IBIS 
    model in an internal data structure, and then writes the resulting
    information to the output file after all processing is done, s2ibis3
    can easily be extended to comply with future versions of the IBIS 
    specification.

    This document will describe the s2ibis3 command language
    and how to properly use it. I would strongly suggest examining
    the files in the examples/ directory to get a feel for how these
    commands are used.


THE COMMAND LANGUAGE

    -To run s2ibis3, type the following on the command line:
       
        % s2ibis3.csh -s2ibis3 buffer.s2i

     where buffer.s2i is the s2i command file as discussed later in
     the s2ibis3.txt
			
    -If there is a 'permission denied' error when running the .csh file, 
     change permissions by doing 

     	  % chmod 744 s2ibis3.csh

    -If it is desired, s2ibis3 could be run from a different directory 
     from the installation directory by using the
     '-root' switch with s2ibis3.csh as this example suggest:
			
        % s2ibis3 -root ../../s2i_install_dir -s2ibis3 buffer.s2i
			
			
windows
    
    -most of the instruction for unix apply for windows users as well.
    -To run s2ibis3, type the following on the command prompt:

  	  % s2ibis3.bat -s2ibis3 buffer.s2i
    
    -If the path variables are not set for java and the spice engines, 
     read instructions at http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/install-windows.html
     on how to set path variables for windows. s2ibis3 would not run if paths have
     not been set properly.

[note] % is not needed to be inserted in the command line.			

    
    The command file consists of two main sections: the header and
    the component description.

    Note that the command parser ignores case when it reads the
    command file, so you may specify the commands in upper or lower
    case, or a mix of the two.

    Also note that s2ibis3 has several reserved words:

        NA  specifies that the value is undefined
        NC  specifies no connection; can be used as model name
        +   line continuation character when found in first
            column of line


THE HEADER

    The header contains information that is applicable to the entire
    file, such as the type of SPICE simulator to use, the IBIS version,
    etc. It can also contain global specifications. For example, if
    you want a particular temperature range to apply to all models in
    your file, specify it in the header. Note, however, that global
    definitions are overridden by local definitions; in this way, you
    can specify (e.g.) a global temperature range, but override it for a
    particular component or model where necessary.

    The following commands can be used in the header:

    [IBIS Ver]  version

        version = 1.1, 2.1 or 3.2
        
        Required.
        
        THIS MUST BE THE FIRST COMMAND IN THE COMMAND FILE. (It may be
        preceded by comments.)  This describes the version of IBIS to be
        produced by s2ibis3. Legal version values are 1.1 and 2.1.

    [File name] filename

        filename = name of IBIS file to produce
        
        Optional.  
        Default: First 8 chars of command filename followed by ".ibs".

        This tells s2ibis3 what the output file name should be. NOTE:
        this must conform to DOS conventions, i.e. it must be in the
        form "xxxxxxxx.xxx". If this command is not used, s2ibis3
        creates the output file name by taking the first part of the
        command file name, and appending ".ibs" to it. So, for the
        command file name "tryme.s2i", the output file name would be
        "tryme.ibs".

    [File rev]  rev

        rev = revision number
        
        Optional.
        Default: none.

        This describes the current file revision. Note that s2ibis3
        will accept any legal string for the revision number, although
        the IBIS specification suggests a standard for revision
        numbering.

    [Date]      date

        date = file date
        
        Optional.
        Default: Current system date.

        Gives the file date. If this command is not present, s2ibis3
        will use the current system date as the file date.

    [Source]    source

        source = file source
        
        Optional.
        Default: none.
        
        Describes the file source. Truncated if longer than 1K byte in
        length.

    [Notes]     notes

        notes = file notes
        
        Optional.
        Default: none.
        
        Describes any optional notes that may be necessary. Truncated
        if longer than 1K byte in length.

    [Disclaimer]    disclaimer

        disclaimer = file disclaimer
        
        Optional.
        Default: none.
        
        This is where you put the legalese. Truncated if longer than 1K
        byte in length.

    [Copyright] copyright

        source = file copyright
        
        Optional.
        Default: none.
        
        Describes the copyright info. Truncated if longer than 1K byte
        in length.

    [Spice type]    spicetype

        spicetype = HSpice, PSpice, Spice2, Spice3, or Spectre

        Required.
        
        Describes which flavor of Spice to use when simulating the
        circuits.

    [Spice command] command

        command = command to use when invoking Spice.

        Optional.
        Default: specified in s2iHeader.java
        
        This string specifies, in java syntax, how you would call Spice
        from the command line. See the string variable defaultSpiceCommand           
	in the file src/s2iHeader.java for an example of the correct format.         
	(Note that the command line switches used to invoke spice3 and               
	spectre MUST be used.)

    [Iterate]

        Optional.
        Default: none.
        
        This works the same way as the *[Iterate] command in s2ibis
        v1.2. If a Spice output file for the curve in question already
        exists, s2ibis3 will read the data from that file without
        re-running the simulation. In this way, you can make
        incremental changes to your s2ibis3 files without having to
        re-simulate the entire set of models.

    [Cleanup]
    
        Optional.
        Default: none.
        
        When this command is specified, s2ibis3 will delete all of the
        spice input, output and message files as it proceeds. This is
        good to use when you think the IBIS file is done and you want to
        clean up the working directory.

        Describes the low stimulus input voltage. Note that this is NOT
        the logic low voltage, but the physical Vil.

    [Vih]       v_typ   v_min   v_max

        v_typ = high stimulus input voltage for TYP curves
        v_min = high stimulus input voltage for MIN curves

        x = percent to derate VI curves

        Optional.
        Default: x = 0%

        Describes the percentage to derate the VI curves, as described
        in the IBIS v3.2 spec. Note that x should be expressed as a
        percentage, not a fraction. For example, to derate 15%, use

        [Derate VI] 15, _not_ [Derate VI] 0.15.


THE COMPONENT DESCRIPTION

    The component description provides s2ibis3 with a model of your
    component. You may have multiple component descriptions per
    file--all components will be written to the same output file. (If
    multiple components are specified, please use unique pin names for
    each component--s2ibis3 uses the pin names to construct the SPICE
    file names and may become confused if different components use the
    same pin names.)

    As in the header, you may have component-wide specifications of
    certain values. Also as in the header, these component-wide values
    will be overridden by a more local definition (i.e. one within a
    particular model). As an example, you could specify a
    component-wide voltage range, and then override this within (for
    example) an ECL model.

    The component description consists of several parts. It starts with
    the [Component] keyword, which specifies the name of the component
    (see below). This is followed by the component header, which
    contains information which pertains to the entire component. The
    header is followed by the differential pin list (optional), pin
    mapping (optional), pin list (required) and model specifications
    (required). These four need not be in any particular order.


THE [Component] KEYWORD

    This keyword specifies the start of the component. It takes the
    following form:

    [Component] name

        name = component name

        Required.

        This command specifies the start of a new component. The
        component name may contain spaces. It will be truncated to 40
        characters in length.


THE COMPONENT HEADER

    This is where you specify variables that will apply to the entire
    component.

    The following commands may be used in the component header:

    [Manufacturer]  name

        name = manufacturer's name

        Optional.
        Default: "Manufacturer name"

        This describes the manufacturer's name, which may contain
        spaces. It will be truncated to 40 characters in length.

    [Package model] name

        name = package name

        Optional.
        Default: none

        This describes the package model to use for the component
        packaging--see the IBIS v3.2 specification for more detail. May
        contain spaces. Will be truncated to 40 characters.

    [Spice file]    filename

        filename = name of Spice file which describes component

        Required.

        This gives the name of the Spice file which describes the
        component topology. Must conform to DOS naming conventions.

    [Series Spice file]    filename

        filename = name of Series Spice file which describes series MOSFET
        for the [Series Mosfet] keyword.

        Required if series MOSFET analysis is done. Not required otherwise.

    [Temperature range] T_typ   T_min   T_max
        See section "THE HEADER" (above) for description.

    [Voltage range]     V_typ   V_min   V_max
        See section "THE HEADER" (above) for description.

    [Pullup reference]  V_typ   V_min   V_max
        See section "THE HEADER" (above) for description.

    [Pulldown reference]    V_typ   V_min   V_max
        See section "THE HEADER" (above) for description.

    [POWER clamp reference] V_typ   V_min   V_max
        See section "THE HEADER" (above) for description.

    [GND clamp reference]   V_typ   V_min   V_max
        See section "THE HEADER" (above) for description.

    [R_pkg]     r
        See section "THE HEADER" (above) for description.

    [L_pkg]     l
        See section "THE HEADER" (above) for description.

    [C_pkg]     c
        See section "THE HEADER" (above) for description.

    [C_comp]    C_typ   C_min   C_max
        See section "THE HEADER" (above) for description.

    [Rload]     r
        See section "THE HEADER" (above) for description.

    [Sim time]  t
        See section "THE HEADER" (above) for description.

    [Vil]       v_typ   v_min   v_max
        See section "THE HEADER" (above) for description.

    [Vih]       v_typ   v_min   v_max

    [Derate VI] x
        See section "THE HEADER" (above) for description.

    [Derate ramp]   y
        See section "THE HEADER" (above) for description.


THE DIFFERENTIAL PIN LIST

    This section contains the differential pin list information, as
    described in the IBIS v3.2 specification. Note that s2ibis3 does
    no processing on this information; it merely stores it and writes
    it to the output file.

    The differential pin list begins with the [Diff pin] keyword:

    [Diff pin]

        Optional.
        Default: none.

        Begins the differential pin list section.

    This keyword is followed by lines describing the differential pin
    relationships. Each line may contain either four or six columns.
    The acceptable formats are:

    pin_name   inv_pin   vdiff   tdelay_typ

    and

    pin_name   inv_pin   vdiff   tdelay_typ   tdelay_min   tdelay_max

    These parameters are fully described in the IBIS v3.2 specification.


THE PIN MAPPING

    The pin mapping describes which power and ground buses are connected
    to each pin's driver and receiver. This information is used in the
    Spice simulations, if it is supplied.

    The pin mapping begins with the [Pin mapping] keyword:

    [Pin mapping]

        Optional.
        Default: none.

        Begins the pin mapping section.

    The keyword is followed by lines describing the pin mapping. Each
    line may contain either three or five columns. Acceptable formats
    are:

    pin_name   pulldown_bus   pullup_bus

    and

    pin_name   pulldown_bus   pullup_bus   gndclamp_bus powerclamp_bus

    Note that power pins are always connected to a pullup_bus, while
    ground pins are always connected to a pulldown_bus, even if they
    only supply power and ground for clamping structures.

    These parameters are fully described in the IBIS v3.2 specification.


THE PIN LIST

    This section describes which models connect to which pins, and which
    pins serve as inputs or enables for other (output) pins.

    The pin list begins with the [Pin] keyword:

    [Pin]

        Required.

        Begins the pin list.

    The keyword is followed by "pin information sets" which describe the
    pin list. There are six valid formats for each pin information set:

    pin_name  spice_node  signal_name  model_name

    pin_name  spice_node  signal_name  model_name  R_pin  L_pin  C_pin

        These two formats are used for a pin with no input or enable,
        i.e. an input pin, enable pin, power pin or ground pin. Note
        that R_pin, L_pin and C_pin override the R_pkg, L_pkg and C_pkg
        specifications.

    pin_name  spice_node  signal_name  model_name
    -> input_pin

    pin_name  spice_node  signal_name  model_name  R_pin  L_pin  C_pin
    -> input_pin

        These two formats are used for a pin with an input pin, but no
        enable pin. i.e. an output-only pin. Note that the
        input_pin_name must match a pin in the pin list. Note also that
        the "->" symbol must begin in the first column of the second
        line.

    pin_name  spice_node  signal_name  model_name
    -> input_pin  enable_pin

    pin_name  spice_node  signal_name  model_name  R_pin  L_pin  C_pin
    -> input_pin  enable_pin

        These two formats are used for a pin with both an input pin and
        an enable pin, i.e. a tristate or I/O pin. Note that both the
        input_pin_name and enable_pin_name must match pins in the pin
        list. Note also that the "->" symbol must begin in the first
        column of the second line.

    Descriptions for each column are given below:

    pin_name........Name of the pin. Must be 5 characters or less.

THE SERIES PIN MAPPING

    The series pin mapping is used to associate two pins joined by a 
    series model. Each pin described under this keyword must match the
    pin names declared previously in the [Pin] section.

    The series pin mapping begins with the [Series Pin mapping] keyword:

    [Series Pin mapping]

        Optional.
        Default: none.

        Begins the series pin mapping section.

    The keyword is followed by lines describing the series pin mapping. 
    Each line may contain either three or four columns. Acceptable formats
    are:

    pin_name   pin_2	model_name

    and

    pin_name   pin_2	model_name	  function_table_group

    When using 4 columns, the header function_table_group must be listed. 
    Function_table_group must be defined in order to define the allowable 
    switching combinations in [Series Switch Group] keyword described below.
    More information on this keyword can be obtained from the IBIS v3.2 
    specification.

NOTE:in IBIS ver3.2, only nMOSFET are taken into consideration. BIRD 72.3 
corrected that and modeified IBIS spec to taken into consideration a 
pMOSFET and an n and p in parallel. This change was reflected in IBIS
ver4.0 Hence, this keyword is, strictly speaking, ver 4.0 compatible.

Please refer to http://www.vhdl.org/pub/ibis/birds/bird72.3 for more
information.
