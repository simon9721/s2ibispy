THE DIFFERENTIAL PIN LIST

    This section contains the differential pin list information, as
    described in the IBIS v3.2 specification. Note that s2ibis3 does
    no processing on this information; it merely stores it and writes
    it to the output file.

    The differential pin list begins with the [Diff pin] keyword:

    [Diff pin]

        Optional.
        Default: none.

        Begins the differential pin list section.

    This keyword is followed by lines describing the differential pin
    relationships. Each line may contain either four or six columns.
    The acceptable formats are:

    pin_name   inv_pin   vdiff   tdelay_typ

    and

    pin_name   inv_pin   vdiff   tdelay_typ   tdelay_min   tdelay_max

    These parameters are fully described in the IBIS v3.2 specification.


THE PIN MAPPING

    The pin mapping describes which power and ground buses are connected
    to each pin's driver and receiver. This information is used in the
    Spice simulations, if it is supplied.

    The pin mapping begins with the [Pin mapping] keyword:

    [Pin mapping]

        Optional.
        Default: none.

        Begins the pin mapping section.

    The keyword is followed by lines describing the pin mapping. Each
    line may contain either three or five columns. Acceptable formats
    are:

    pin_name   pulldown_bus   pullup_bus

    and

    pin_name   pulldown_bus   pullup_bus   gndclamp_bus powerclamp_bus

    Note that power pins are always connected to a pullup_bus, while
    ground pins are always connected to a pulldown_bus, even if they
    only supply power and ground for clamping structures.

    These parameters are fully described in the IBIS v3.2 specification.


THE PIN LIST

    This section describes which models connect to which pins, and which
    pins serve as inputs or enables for other (output) pins.

    The pin list begins with the [Pin] keyword:

    [Pin]

        Required.

        Begins the pin list.

    The keyword is followed by "pin information sets" which describe the
    pin list. There are six valid formats for each pin information set:

    pin_name  spice_node  signal_name  model_name

    pin_name  spice_node  signal_name  model_name  R_pin  L_pin  C_pin

        These two formats are used for a pin with no input or enable,
        i.e. an input pin, enable pin, power pin or ground pin. Note
        that R_pin, L_pin and C_pin override the R_pkg, L_pkg and C_pkg
        specifications.

    pin_name  spice_node  signal_name  model_name
    -> input_pin

    pin_name  spice_node  signal_name  model_name  R_pin  L_pin  C_pin
    -> input_pin

        These two formats are used for a pin with an input pin, but no
        enable pin. i.e. an output-only pin. Note that the
        input_pin_name must match a pin in the pin list. Note also that
        the "->" symbol must begin in the first column of the second
        line.

    pin_name  spice_node  signal_name  model_name
    -> input_pin  enable_pin

    pin_name  spice_node  signal_name  model_name  R_pin  L_pin  C_pin
    -> input_pin  enable_pin

        These two formats are used for a pin with both an input pin and
        an enable pin, i.e. a tristate or I/O pin. Note that both the
        input_pin_name and enable_pin_name must match pins in the pin
        list. Note also that the "->" symbol must begin in the first
        column of the second line.

    Descriptions for each column are given below:

    pin_name........Name of the pin. Must be 5 characters or less.
    spice_node......Node name in the spice file which corresponds to
                    this pin.
    signal_name.....Name of the signal associated with this pin.
    model_name......Name of the driver/receiver/terminator model
                    associated with this pin. The model name must
                    match one described by the [Model] keyword (see
                    below), unless the model name is one of POWER,
                    GND or NC.
    R_pin...........Parasitic pin resistance. Overrides the R_pkg
                    value if defined.
    L_pin...........Parasitic pin inductance. Overrides the L_pkg
                    value if defined.
    C_pin...........Parasitic pin capacitance. Overrides the C_pkg
                    value if defined.
    input_pin.......Name of the pin which supplies the input signal
                    to the current pin. Must match the name of
                    another pin in the pin list. This name is used
                    in the Spice simulations to determine where to
                    apply the input stimulus.
    enable_pin......Name of the pin which enables the current pin.
                    Must match the name of another pin in the pin
                    list. This name is used in the Spice
                    simulations to determine where to apply the
                    enable signal.

THE SERIES PIN MAPPING

    The series pin mapping is used to associate two pins joined by a 
    series model. Each pin described under this keyword must match the
    pin names declared previously in the [Pin] section.

    The series pin mapping begins with the [Series Pin mapping] keyword:

    [Series Pin mapping]

        Optional.
        Default: none.

        Begins the series pin mapping section.

    The keyword is followed by lines describing the series pin mapping. 
    Each line may contain either three or four columns. Acceptable formats
    are:

    pin_name   pin_2	model_name

    and

    pin_name   pin_2	model_name	  function_table_group

    When using 4 columns, the header function_table_group must be listed. 
    Function_table_group must be defined in order to define the allowable 
    switching combinations in [Series Switch Group] keyword described below.
    More information on this keyword can be obtained from the IBIS v3.2 
    specification.

THE SERIES SWITCH GROUP

    The series switch group is used to define allowable switching combinations
    of series switches described using the names of the groups in the
    [Series Pin Mapping] keyword function_table_group column.

    The series switch group begins with the [Series switch groups] keyword:

    [Series Switch Groups]

        Optional.
        Default: none.

        Begins the series switch group section.

    More information on this keyword can be obtained from the IBIS v3.2 
    specification.
