THE COMPONENT DESCRIPTION

    The component description provides s2ibis3 with a model of your
    component. You may have multiple component descriptions per
    file--all components will be written to the same output file. (If
    multiple components are specified, please use unique pin names for
    each component--s2ibis3 uses the pin names to construct the SPICE
    file names and may become confused if different components use the
    same pin names.)

    As in the header, you may have component-wide specifications of
    certain values. Also as in the header, these component-wide values
    will be overridden by a more local definition (i.e. one within a
    particular model). As an example, you could specify a
    component-wide voltage range, and then override this within (for
    example) an ECL model.

    The component description consists of several parts. It starts with
    the [Component] keyword, which specifies the name of the component
    (see below). This is followed by the component header, which
    contains information which pertains to the entire component. The
    header is followed by the differential pin list (optional), pin
    mapping (optional), pin list (required) and model specifications
    (required). These four need not be in any particular order.


THE [Component] KEYWORD

    This keyword specifies the start of the component. It takes the
    following form:

    [Component] name

        name = component name

        Required.

        This command specifies the start of a new component. The
        component name may contain spaces. It will be truncated to 40
        characters in length.


THE COMPONENT HEADER

    This is where you specify variables that will apply to the entire
    component.

    The following commands may be used in the component header:

    [Manufacturer]  name

        name = manufacturer's name

        Optional.
        Default: "Manufacturer name"

        This describes the manufacturer's name, which may contain
        spaces. It will be truncated to 40 characters in length.

    [Package model] name

        name = package name

        Optional.
        Default: none

        This describes the package model to use for the component
        packaging--see the IBIS v3.2 specification for more detail. May
        contain spaces. Will be truncated to 40 characters.

    [Spice file]    filename

        filename = name of Spice file which describes component

        Required.

        This gives the name of the Spice file which describes the
        component topology. Must conform to DOS naming conventions.

    [Series Spice file]    filename

        filename = name of Series Spice file which describes series MOSFET
        for the [Series Mosfet] keyword.

        Required if series MOSFET analysis is done. Not required otherwise.

        See section "THE HEADER" (above) for description.

    [Voltage range]     V_typ   V_min   V_max
