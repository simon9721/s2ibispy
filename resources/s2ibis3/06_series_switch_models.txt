SERIES SWITCH MODELS PARAMETERS

    [On] [Off]

        Required if Model type is Series_Switch.
 
        'On' state electrical models are positioned under [On] 
	      Only [Series MOSFET] is implemented under [On].

        'Off' state electrical models are positioned under [Off] 
	      Only [R Series] are implemented under [Off]

	  These keywords are only valid for the Series Switch Model
        types only.

    [series MOSFET]
    [vds] v1
    [vds] v2
      .
      .
      .

	  Required for Series MOSFET Switches.

	  v1,v2,.. = Vds values. For each Vds value, there will be a VI
                  table associated with it. 
			VI table has voltage values = vtable = Vcc - Vs                    
		      where Vcc is the voltage from [voltage range] keyword
                  and Vs is varied.

	 The table entries are Vgs of the NMOS device and Vcc - Vgs of the 
	 PMOS device, if present.

    [R Series] R_typ 	R_min		R_max

       Not Required
       Default Values for R_typ, R_min, R_max = 1.00M

	 C_comp values are ignored for [series MOSFET] models.

	
NOTE: in IBIS ver3.2, only nMOSFET are taken into consideration. BIRD 72.3 
corrected that and modified IBIS spec to take into consideration a 
pMOSFET and an n and p in parallel. This change was reflected in IBIS
ver4.0 Hence, this keyword is, strictly speaking, ver 4.0 compatible.

Please refer to http://www.vhdl.org/pub/ibis/birds/bird72.3 for more
information.

More information on this keyword can be obtained from the IBIS v3.2 
specification.
